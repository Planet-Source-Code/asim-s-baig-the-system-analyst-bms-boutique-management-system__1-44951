## BMS \- Boutique Management System


</div>

### Description

This is a complete application that was designed for

some boutique to manage their clothes inventory and

sales etc. This uses the MS Acess database and

substitution encryption/decryption technique to hide

passwords of users. The aplication also has a flash

based intro in it that welcomes the user after being

logged on. The System has an account builtin initially

to help u log in for the first time: user =

administrator, password: 5834940. After loggin in you

can create, delete, edit a user. PLus the app has a

control panel giving options like: Clothes (add, edit,

delete), customers(add edit,delete) and clothes sales.

Apart from normal sales some times customers give

advance or sometimes they have dues. To solve this

problem you can use customers tab to account those.

Report can be genrated. This system does not use

crystal reports, rather another approach not

recommended which is called a pre-made template of rtf

file called in a rich text box, then replacing the

template variables with database returned values.

There can be three reports generated: Selling &

income, Losses & profits and Customers Reports. This

does not have any dependancy as such except the

reports template rtf files. I hope this helps you out.

Dont forget to give Five Globes.
